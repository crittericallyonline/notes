# CAREER NOTES

- `I chose to learn & write about Chapter 7` *(DNA profiling)*
Because I find `working with chemicals`, `problem solving`, `DNA profiling` and `analyzing sequences of RNA` *(DNA)* particularly intresting because of the amount of effort that it takes to use something so small, smaller than the eye can even see, microns thin even.

- `Kary Banks Mullis` *(who we will referred to as `Kary`)* is a very inteligent individual, he was rewarded the `Noble Prize in Chemistry` for developing the poly-merase chain reaction that is used to amplify DNA sequences.
- `Kary` also earned a `PH.D` in `Biochemistry` in `1972` from the `University of California`, at `Bercekly`, and earned a `Bachelors degree` for `.
- He was then employed at a `Biotechnology` Called the `Cetus Corperation`, located in `Emeryville, Calinfornia.
- `Kary` also has `NOT` worked on any sensitive cases such as a crime-scene or anything with the police, but has made contributions to other forensics specialists that do work on these cases.
